# CAD Image Extraction API
This project provides a **FastAPI-based service** for extracting manufacturing and mechanical part data from **CAD images / engineering drawings** using **AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash)**.  
It performs OCR-like extraction and returns structured information such as **parts list, dimensions, materials, and annotations**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload a **CAD image** via API  
- Uses **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** model for AI-powered extraction  
- Returns structured data in **JSON format** (Bill of Materials style)  
- Built with **FastAPI** for easy deployment and testing
